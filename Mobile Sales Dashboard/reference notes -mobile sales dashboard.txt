power bi project

- analyze and clean data

in power bi get the excel sheet and select transform data to perform data cleaning.

go through the complete sheet and merge day, month, year column to one column named date and change its data type to date.

remove the day, month, year column and also the day name column coz it has few errors like sat and Saturday not complete or good data.
we can change the day name column to the correct order from selecting the date column and choosing day name, since I don't require day name for this project I am removing this column.

renamed this file to Sales_Data and then close and apply.

- create custom calendar
go to transform data , new source, blank query and type - = List.Dates(#date(2021,1,1) ,1461,#duration(1,0,0,0))

fyi- date format y,m,d .  1461 is the no. of days in 2021 - 2024 . duration format day, hr, min, sec
 
added name of day just for reference.
renamed it to Custom_Calendar and then close and apply.

- data model tab - create relationship

in model view- sales_data known as fact table/ data table and custom_calendar known as dimension table.

created a one to many relationship for date from custom_calendar to sales_data.

- dax calculations

using dax create total sales - Total_Sales = SUMX(Sales_Data,Sales_Data[Units Sold]*Sales_Data[Price Per Unit]) 

create transactions - Transactions = COUNTROWS(Sales_Data) 
create average_price - Average_Price = AVERAGE(Sales_Data[Price Per Unit]) 
create total_quantity - Total_Quantity = SUM(Sales_Data[Units Sold]) 

- dashboard creation
download necessary images for use.
using button slicer create months from custom_calander - date- date hieraricy- month and do necessary editing to fit in dashboard.

use new card and add total_sales, total_quantity, transcations, average_price and edit and place where necessary.

use normal slicer and add mobile model, payment method, brand - separately and edit it to make a dropdown box.

CREATE map chart and add city in location and total sales in bubbles , do necessary editing and place where required.

create a line chart and add date - month from custom_calender in x-axis and total_quantity in y-axis and necessary editing.

in table view add new column - Rating Status = IF(Sales_Data[Customer Ratings]>=4,"Good",
IF(Sales_Data[Customer Ratings]>2,"Average","Poor"))

create funnel chart and add rating status in category and customer ratings in values but change it from sum to count.

create a pie chart and add payment method in legend and transcations in values. edit it to show only total percentage.

create clustered bar chart and add total_sales in x-axis and mobile model in y-axis. in filters go to mobile model and change filter type to top n , show items to top , 3 and add total_sales in by values.

- edit interactions
go to format and click on edit interaction and click on the months slicer and then the line chart of total quantity by none and select none.

- MTD, QTD and YTD DAX functions (month to date, year to date, quarter to date)
create a duplicate dashboard , rename it as mtd report and remove all the visual charts.
create a new measure in sales_date as mtd - MTD = TOTALMTD([Total_Sales],Custom_Calendar[Date].[Date])

OTD and YTD also have the same formulae, just have to change the name.

create a table and add date from custom_calander and mtd and total_sales from sales_data.
convert it to line chart, from the previous dashboard copy the months and add it here and in place of the brand slicer add date it to.

- same period last year
create a duplicate dashboard from mtd report and remove the line chart.
create a table add date from custom_calander (only year and quater), total_sales, and same period last year.

copy the same table to create a clustered column chart, make three charts one for total_sales and same period last year by year, another by quarter and one more by month.

go to insert - buttons - navigator - page navigator , do necessary editing and place it in all the three sheets.

- dax query in power bi
working around dax query and just seeing all the measures used.

- create another page

- upload dashboard on power bi services. (didn't do this step)
need to have business email/ account to use this.
sign in to power bi using business mail id.
go to my workspace, create new folder for the project and then upload the saved power bi project file (pbix file).
open the file then select file- embed report- publish to web and done. can copy the link to use or share.
